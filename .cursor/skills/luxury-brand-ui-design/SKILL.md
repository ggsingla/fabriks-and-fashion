# Luxury Brand UI Design Skill

This skill ensures all UI design outputs align with a high-end, royal, couture-grade fashion brand aesthetic. It prevents generic SaaS layouts and forces disciplined, editorial, luxury-first decisions.

## When to Use
- When redesigning or creating landing pages for luxury or premium clothing brands
- When updating service cards, product cards, or brand highlight sections
- When design output risks becoming generic, trendy, or SaaS-like
- When visual hierarchy, typography, or spacing lacks perceived value

## Instructions

### 1. Lock Brand Positioning First
- Assume the brand is premium, royal, and heritage-inspired
- Audience is affluent, design-literate, and detail-sensitive
- Mood must be understated, timeless, and exclusive
- Avoid trend-driven or playful aesthetics

### 2. Define the Component’s Job
- Clearly state what the component must achieve (desire, prestige, clarity)
- Prefer emotional impact over information density
- Eliminate unnecessary UI elements early

### 3. Enforce Content Constraints
- Limit content strictly to what is required
- Titles must be short and confident (3–4 words max)
- Descriptions must be concise and editorial (1–2 lines)
- Avoid CTAs unless explicitly requested

### 4. Apply Luxury Design Rules
- Use minimal layouts with generous whitespace
- Avoid rounded, bubbly, SaaS-style cards
- Prefer sharp or softly refined edges
- Use muted, elegant color palettes (ivory, charcoal, deep navy, gold accents)
- No heavy shadows, neon colors, or aggressive gradients

### 5. Image Treatment Standards
- Image should dominate the component visually
- Use editorial crops and fashion photography framing
- Allow subtle overlays or gradients for depth
- Never let text overpower the image

### 6. Typography Discipline
- Titles: elegant serif or high-contrast typefaces
- Body text: refined, low-contrast, highly readable
- Maintain tight vertical rhythm
- Avoid excessive font weights or sizes

### 7. Interaction & Motion
- Use slow, subtle transitions only (300–500ms)
- No bounce, spring, or playful animations
- Hover effects should enhance depth, not distract

### 8. Output Expectations
- Describe layout, spacing, and hierarchy clearly
- Explain why each design choice supports a luxury perception
- Optionally suggest restrained variations
- Reject generic UI clichés and trendy patterns

### 9. Failure Conditions (Hard No)
- Looks like a SaaS dashboard
- Overuse of rounded corners
- Excessive UI chrome or visual noise
- Loud colors, gradients, or gimmicks
- Over-explaining instead of showcasing
